First project of The Odin Project where we recreate the Google Homepage using
html and css. It's a purely visual recreation of the homepage.

From the Odin Project's curriculum (http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

Learned:
The introduction of html
The introduction of css
Categorizing id and class and seeing how to move div relative to the page
It was hard.
